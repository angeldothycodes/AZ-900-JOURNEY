## Azure Cost Management

During our finances journey, we've mentioned multiple times how the cost of our Azure environment is solely based on the usage.
That means if we need more services, we scale them out and start paying more. When we don't need them, we scale them down and immediately see the cost reduction. Each of those services is tracked separately so you really pay on what you use depending on the pricing tier of the services that you configured.
Each service additionally has multiple metrics that are being tracked in order to ensure that the billing is calculated properly. The purpose of Azure Cost Management is to grab all of that data and present it to you in an easy to ingest format. In this case, a very small self-service reporting capability tool within Azure.
