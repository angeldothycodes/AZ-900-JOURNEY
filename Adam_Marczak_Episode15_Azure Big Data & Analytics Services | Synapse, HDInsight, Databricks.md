**WHAT IS CONSIDERED BIG DATA?**
Big data is a field of technology that helps us with solving typical challenges around extraction, proecssing, and analysis of our data sets but in order to call something big data, certain characteristics has to be met. The first one is **velocity**. 

- **Velocity** means how fast is our data arriving. How fast, how often do we need to process that data. Are we processing that data in batches or maybe in real time?

- Second characteristic is **Volume**. We are talking about megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, even petabytes of data.

- Thirs is **variety**. **Variety** means that how structured is our data. We are talking about tables or databases or something complex like video or social media information.

Based on these three characteristics, we can define whether this data is considered to be big data or not but as soon as we go high on one of those characteristics, traditional softwares will not be able to process this kind of data sets.

This is how big data technologies came to be. They were specifically designed softwares to help us with those kind of challenges which brings us to our first service: **Azure Synapse Analytics**

## Azure Synapse Analytics

In order to talk about Synapse Analytics and its benefits, we need to talk about how typical process looks like when it comes to transforming an analysis of our data. Most data engineers will start their process by identifying where is their data. Whether those are flat files, some web services, or databases and from there, a typical development process starts. Developers will first need to **ingest** their data from their sources to the cloud. Then they will need to **transform** those data sets and **store** them somewhere. After storing the data, expose this to other tools like reporting tools so that business users can take insights out of their data and make good business decisions. 
**Azure Synapse Analytics** helps with all of those steps first if all by providing a feature called **Synapse Pipelines**, this tool helps developers to ingest and transform their data using visual workflows. Additionally, Synapse Analytics comes with embedded **Apache Spark**, a leading technology for big data analytics and transformation. Also, their **Synapse SQL** is Massively Parallel Processing database cluster based on a popular SQL server. This feature helps with transformation using typical SQL queries, storing of your data but also serving it to your reporting clients and all of that is baked into something called **Synapse Studio** which is a unified experience to manage all of those tools and features and perform all of your data transformation in a single place- all of that is nicely integrated with another Azure service called **Data Lake** so that ingrestion, transformation, and storage of our data can also be done directly on the data lake.

### Summary

**Azure Synapse Analytics** first of all is big data analytics platform. It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering in Azure. Allowing users data engineers, data scientists to perform data analysis and data transformation over very large data sets and it has mutiple tools baked in. Tool like **Apache Spark** for efficient big data transformations.
**Synapse SQL** which allows us to use SQL server familiar tools with massively power processing design with dedicated or ad-hoc capacity
We also have **Synapse Pipelines** which allow you to visually build your ingestion and data transformation workflows 
All of that is combined into a single **Studio** experience, a unified experience for your data transformation needs.

## Azure HDInsight

As we were talking about the typical development process, HDInsight can also support pretty much every stage of that process by providing so-called **Big data clusters**. When it comes to HDInsight, there are many clusters available- clusters like Hadoop clusters, Spark, Kafka, HBase, Hive machine learning services or Apache Storm or many others.

In general the idea of the service is to provide you with open source big data technologies from the market, allow you to provision clusters so that Microsoft managess those clusters and you just grab the technology that you need to perform specific tasks that you need. All of these tools serves a different purpose but you can use them in combination to support end-to-end development lifecycle for your application.

**CHARACTERISTICS**

Azure HDInsight is a flexible multi-purpose Big Data platform in Azure, it's another Platform as a Service offering. Allowing you to choose from multiple opensource technologies on the market whether this is hadoop, spark, kafka, or many of the other available technologies

## Azure Databricks

**Azure Databricks** is quite similar to HDInsight except the clusters that we create are based on Apache Spark alone.The main purpose of this service is to help you with data transformation at large scale because Apache Spark is one of the leaders when it comes to performance and data transformations for big data. Besides the data transformation, the creators of databricks also wanted to provide this as a collaboration platform for data engineers and data analysts so that they have a single place where they can manage their cluster and collaborate on their data solutions

**CHARACTERISTICS**

Data bricks is a big data collaborating platform. It's another Platform as a Service category. It's about providing this unified workspace where users can manage their notebooks, clusters, data and manage access to other users and collaborate with them so that users ca focus on their data solutions rather than on the management of their big data platforms. It is based on Apache Spark- a leader when it comes to big data transformations on the market. It very well integrate with common Azure Data Services by having out of the box connectors so it's very easy to pull data out of Azure Services and output data back after our transformations are done

### SUMMARY
- **Azure Synapse Analysis** also use a modern end-to-end approach for data warehousing and analytics over big data sets
  
- We also learned abiut **HDInsights** with a fully managed, opensource analytics service with a lot of supported frameworks and tools. Tools that are currently marked as leaders when it comes to processing of big data sets.
  
- Lastly, we learned about **Azure Databricks**, an Apache Spark based collaboration platform in the cloud which very easily allows us to process big data sets by abstracting the difficult topics when it comes to big data platform management
