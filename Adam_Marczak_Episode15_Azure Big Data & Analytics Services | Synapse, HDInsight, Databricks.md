**WHAT IS CONSIDERED BIG DATA?**
Big data is a field of technology that helps us with solving typical challenges around extraction, proecssing, and analysis of our data sets but in order to call something big data, certain characteristics has to be met. The first one is **velocity**. 

- **Velocity** means how fast is our data arriving. How fast, how often do we need to process that data. Are we processing that data in batches or maybe in real time?

- Second characteristic is **Volume**. We are talking about megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, even petabytes of data.

- Thirs is **variety**. **Variety** means that how structured is our data. We are talking about tables or databases or something complex like video or social media information.

Based on these three characteristics, we can define whether this data is considered to be big data or not but as soon as we go high on one of those characteristics, traditional softwares will not be able to process this kind of data sets.

This is how big data technologies came to be. They were specifically designed softwares to help us with those kind of challenges which brings us to our first service: **Azure Synapse Analytics**

## Azure Synapse Analytics

In order to talk about Synapse Analytics and its benefits, we need to talk about how typical process looks like when it comes to transforming an analysis of our data. Most data engineers will start their process by identifying where is their data. Whether those are flat files, some web services, or databases and from there, a typical development process starts. Developers will first need to **ingest** their data from their sources to the cloud. Then they will need to **transform** those data sets and **store** them somewhere. After storing the data, expose this to other tools like reporting tools so that business users can take insights out of their data and make good business decisions. 
**Azure Synapse Analytics** helps with all of those steps
