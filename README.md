## 📝 My Notes & Labs

### 1. Describe Cloud Computing
- **Key concepts:** Cloud basics, models, shared responsibility, consumption-based model
- **My notes:**  
  - Cloud computing is delivering computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the Internet (“the cloud”).
  - You pay only for what you use (“consumption-based”).
  - Shared responsibility: Microsoft manages the cloud; you manage your data and identity.
- **Reflection:**  
  - [What was new, surprising, or useful to you? Write a short thought!]
