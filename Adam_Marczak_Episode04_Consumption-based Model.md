In order for this model to work, we need to understand one moe thing. Let me use service like Virtual Machine as an example here. Charging for a service like Virtual Machine might be very tricky. What Microsoft did is created a few metrics that the price is based on. First, one is so-called **compute**. This is the power of the virtual machine, the size of the virtual machine that we purchased. If your usage changes per day, your size changes per day, you will be charged different amunt each day. Additionally, vitual machine usually there's a storage
