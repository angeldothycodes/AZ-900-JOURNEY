We all know that in Azure, you can place your resources into resource groups and the typical approach to do that is to group your Azure resources by the name of the applications that you're building. So all the resources that are components of your application one will be in the same resource group. This approach is very popular because it allows you to build your application more efficiently. There's one caveat about this approach, if you would want to group your resource group by something else other than your application name, you could implement different resource group naming convention but if you want to change your mind or want to add additional information, there's no way to change the resource group name. So to achieve that, you would be forced to create new resource group with the new name and then move all your resources to that resource group. This introduces a lot of maintenance effort which is not you want when managing Azure environments at scale. 

This is where **Resource Tags** can help. So if you want to assign a department name information to your Azure resources, you can do it with a tag. To do that, you would locate this resource in Azure and then assign a tag- giving it a name, for example Department and then value for example Finance.

In this case, tags allow you to add some extra information to your Azure resources so if your goal would be to group your resources by departments, you could assign this department tag on every single resource in Azure and give it differnet values depending which department owns the specific resources. What is good about resource tags is that you can assign multiple tags to a single resource. for example you can add an owner information for a person who should be contacted whenever an inquiry is required about this specific resource. You can also use tags to do some automation for example assign a shutdown time on a specific virtual machine and then create scripts which will leverage this information to do your automation tasks. When it comes to tags, you can also use tags on a resource group level. You can assign owner, cost centers, whatever is necessary for your organization. It is extremely important to note that resource tags are very simple in nature. It's just about assigning information so you can assign any resource tag name and any resource tag value. It is really about you and your organization and how you want to manage your azure resources. What is important here is that resource tags are not inherited by default. If we assign a tag cost center 327 on the resource group App1, this cost center tag will not be inherited on this web application and virtual amchine by default. But this can be achieved with what we will learn about in the next episode which is called **Azure Policy** but by default, you should know resource tags are not inherited.

One of the most common use cases for using tags in Azure is for billing purposes. You can assign a tag to a department or the cost center and then you can charge them internally based on the amount of money they spend on Azure Resources. Lastly, what is important is that tags once assigned can be used also for automation. In this case, it's really as simple as opening Azure Cloud Shell and typing  single command which will list all Azure resources which have at least one tag assigned. Once this is returned, you can review all of Azure resources with the resources groups and what tags have been assigned to those specific resources
