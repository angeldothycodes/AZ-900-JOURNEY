In order to understand the **public cloud**, we need to make a very clear separation of where we are deploying our services. We are either deploying them to the cloud service provider or inside of our own datacenter. When it comes to the public cloud, that means all our resources  are hosted in a public cloud that means we don't own our own hardware anywhere. One thing to note is that in public cloud, some services share the hardware with other customers. This usually is solved by just picking the right pricing tier but you should be aware of that when you're starting with the cloud and you have some security compliance policies in place.

The **public cloud** is very simple to understand. In general, you're hosting everything in public cloud. As in any deployment model, there are always advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages:
- There's no CapEx- that means no big initial investment on your side.
- With cloud being hihgly available and agile by default, you get those all advantages by simply going to the cloud
- Thanks to pay-as-you-go pricing, you only pay for the resources used
- Because Microsoft manages all of the hardware, there's no hardware maintenance required and as such, no deep technical skills required from your teams 


- One major disadvantage when it comes to security & compliance. Cloud is secure by default. There may be specific security requirements or government policies, industry standard, or legal requirements the public clouds cannot meet. In that case, the public cloud might not be the right choice for you.
- There's also issue with ownership because if you want to maintain your own hardware or make changes to the hardware then again you cannot do that because Microosft is hosting all the hardware and managing all the hardware in their own data centers



**PRIVATE CLOUD**

You host everything in your own datacenter. In here, you need to provide the self-service in order to be Azure-considered-cloud. You need to provide all the benefits of the cloud except in your own datacenter. In this scenario, you are the one maintaining all the hardware.
