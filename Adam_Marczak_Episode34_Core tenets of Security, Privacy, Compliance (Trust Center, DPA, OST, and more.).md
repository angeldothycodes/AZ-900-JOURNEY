Let's start with **Microsoft Privacy Statement**

I must say that when I learn about the documents and privacies and olicies and different things that are not very technical, it's very easy to get lost. Because of that I will try to put every single  document and website that we'll learn about today into three main categories. I will explain **what kind of information do they provide**, **for which services**, and **for what kind of audience where they're designed for**.
This, hopefully, will allow you not only to better understand a specific topic that we're talking about but also make it easier to make a distinction between them. 
With **Microsoft Privacy Statement**, let's start with the info. What kind of information can you find in that document? This document talks about the personal data, the collection of the data, the purpose of that collection but also the usage across different services. 
It describes this information in the context of following Microsoft offerings. All of the services applications, websites, software, servers, or even devices. If you have everything from Microsoft that you can pretty much imagine like Windows, maybe you use Azure, maybe you have a Surface phone, xbox, or simply an office- all those services interact with your personal data. **Microsoft Privacy Statament** will describe what kind of information is collected for each one of those services, for what purposes, and how it's being used. Because of the nature of that dcument, it's really designed for everyone. It doesn't matter if you are an enterprise customer or a private person, you can use Microsoft Privacy Statement to learn more about usage of your personal data.

The next document we will cover is called **Online Services Terms**. This document provides us with following information: it describes the **legal agreement** (so-called **"licensing terms"**), previously this was also called "Usage rights". This legal agreement describes the isage rights in context of online services of Microsoft things like Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365 or any other offering from Microsoft 365 platform or maybe something simpler like Bing maps. All of those services are categorized under online services. Those licensing terms simply explain to you as a customer what you are allowed and what you are disallowed to do when using those online services. Since this is a legal document, this is designed for your organizational legal teams. They can review and see if the applications and services that you provide follow those legal agreements.

Our next document is called **Data Protection Addendum**. This document covers the information about the obligations  between your company and Microsoft. Those obligations are specifically mentioned around the processing and security of your personal but also your customer data. Because this document is an appendix to online services terms, it talks about those obligations in the context of the online services that your purchase from Microsoft. It's a very good document which was designed for both your legal teams and security teams to review. While it's similar to online services terms, this one focuses on the data and security of that data when using those online services.

Besides the documents themselves, you also have something called **Trust Cnter**.

In this case, **Trust Center** first of all is a website. It's this so-called one-stop shop, a single place for your company to review all of the information regarding **security**, **compliance**, **privacy**, policies, and best practices around Microsoft services. This provides you the information for all of online services of Microsoft. This website is pretty great for anyone in your organization because is starts at high-level but as you move through, it will go deeper in detail into each specific topic and it will provide you with a lot of information, helpful links, tools, checklists, and plenty of online resources that you can check to learn about each specific topic. Because of the nature and the structure of the website, it's really designed for anyone in your organization who really cares about ether security, compliance, or privacy. People like business managers, administrators, security teams, and legal teams.

#Azure Compliance Docs

This portal provides us with information regarding compliance as the name suggests having the same categories that we've just seen in the trust center, splitting those compliance offerings into multiple categories as we just seen in Trust center, like national, US government, industry specific or regional and many more. You might think has is that different from the Trust Center? The difference is very minimal. First of all, this portal is dedicated to Azure. So the offer it describes is only in the context of Azure platform. Also, it doesn't talk anything else besides compliance. It has pretty much the same audience as the previous one- it is designed for your business managers, administrators, security teams, and legal teams. 
If you have a team that works specifically with Azure, this might be the better place for them to start their journey and start exploring compliance offerings for Azure.
If you use multiple cloud services of Microsoft then the trust center might be better place for you to start.
