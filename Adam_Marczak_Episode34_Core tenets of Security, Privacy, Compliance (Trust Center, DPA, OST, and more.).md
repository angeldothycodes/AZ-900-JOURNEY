Let's start with **Microsoft Privacy Statement**

I must say that when I learn about the documents and privacies and olicies and different things that are not very technical, it's very easy to get lost. Because of that I will try to put every single  document and website that we'll learn about today into three main categories. I will explain **what kind of information do they provide**, **for which services**, and **for what kind of audience where they're designed for**.
This, hopefully, will allow you not only to better understand a specific topic that we're talking about but also make it easier to make a distinction between them. 
With **Microsoft Privacy Statement**, let's start with the info. What kind of information can you find in that document? This document talks about the personal data, the collection of the data, the purpose of that collection but also the usage across different services. 
It describes this information in the context of following Microsoft offerings. All of the services applications, websites, software, servers, or even devices. If you have everything from Microsoft that you can pretty much imagine like Windows, maybe you use Azure, maybe you have a Surface phone, xbox, or simply an office- all those services interact with your personal data. **Microsoft Privacy Statament** will describe what kind of information is collected for each one of those services, for what purposes, and how it's being used. Because of the nature of that dcument, it's really designed for everyone. It doesn't matter if you are an enterprise customer or a private person, you can use Microsoft Privacy Statement to learn more about usage of your personal data.

The next document we will cover is called **Online Services Terms**. This document provides us with following information: it describes the **legal agreement** (so-called **"licensing terms"**), previously this was also called "Usage rights". This legal agreement describes the isage rights in context of online services of Microsoft things like Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365 or any other offering from Microsoft 365 platform or maybe something simpler like Bing maps. All of those services are categorized under online services. Those licensing terms simply explain to you as a customer what you are allowed and what you are disallowed to do when using those online services. Since this is a legal document, this is designed for your organizational legal teams. They can review and see if the applications and services that you provide follow those legal agreements. 
Our next document is called **Data Protection Addendum**. This document covers the information about the obligations
