# Azure Blueprints

**Azure Blueprints** is the last service when it comes to the governance of your Azure environment and in this episode, we'll be talking about what blueprints are and what are the typical scenarios for using blueprints in your Azure environments.

**Blueprint** is a guide, a pattern, or a design for making something. It could be as simple as a chair. If you have a blueprint of the chair, you can make as many chairs as you want and you know they will be identical if you just follow that blueprint.

The same principle applies to **Azure Blueprints**. It's a service within Azure that helps you manage your Azure environments consistently.

Let's picture a simple scenario where we are a central governance team and we want to deploy pre-approved environment for building web aplications. To do that, in our Azure subscription, the first thing we will need to do is to create a resource group. Once the resource group is created then we will create role assignments which will allow your team to manage their Azure resources and build their own applications. For typical web application, you might want to create resources like SQL database and App service for hosting your web application, you might additionally want to pre-configure those services to match your internal requirements when it comes to security and compliance. Lastly, if you have some policies then you might want to assign those for the specific resource group depending on how many of those role assignments you need to make, how many resources you need to create and how many policy assignments you will want to do. You will start seeing that. This will grow as your organization grows more standards will appear and this effort might take some time especially if you want to replicate this entire environment that you just created in another subscription or just another resource group. You would have to go through all of those steps again and since we are all humans, we will make mistakes. To avoid those mistakes, your operation teams will start creating scripts but you don't really have to create those scripts

because **Azure Blueprints** is to help with this. You can grab all of those pieces and put it into a single **blueprint definition**. 

A **blueprint definition** is a collection of Azure components, role assignments, resource groups, resources, and policy assignments allowing you to deploy those with a single press of a button.

When the definition is created, you can go to your subscription and create blueprint assignment. When you create assignment, Azure will deploy all of the components defined by the blueprint automatically. Because this is the definition, you can apply this as an assignment as many times as you want replicating your environment very easily. Technically, this is what this service is all about. It's about creating definitions and assigning them and deploying resources.

In high level, this is what the service is for. When it comes to functionality itself, it's about providing you with another tool in Azure to script and automate resource deployment and environment setup and do it in a consistent manner, be able to define essential repository for your pre-approved designs and patterns allowing your teams to create environments fast and in very consistent manner.
