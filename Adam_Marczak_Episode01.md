Cloud computing is a delivery model for services. Services like storage services as whenever you're storing your unstructured or structured data in files and databases while delivers ypu thousands of servcies to do so.

You pretty much can choose any technology that is popular in the market and you will be able to use it with an Azure environment. In this case, storage doesn't only mean storing data but also all the services and tools that allow you to migrate your data to the cloud.


Once data is in the cloud, **computer resources** will be needed like a Windows virtual amchines, maybe a Linux ones, web containers or any of the hundreds of services available in the cloud because cloud is about creating applications whenever those are web, AI, machine learning, reporting, any kind of applications out there. Additionally, once you have your components, you need to be able to somehow connect them to each other securely. 

Cloud delivers you with said functionalities to create secure networking between those components but also your company. And because your entire platfrom is managed in the cloud, cloud also needs to delvier **analytic capabilities** so you can review your performance and telemetry data for your services. 

There are many list of services clouds can offer but these four are the main ones and that are tested by the exam.


All of those ervices are delivered over the internet and this is bascially what cloud is.

**Delivering services like this doesn't make a cloud computing yet**
Computing needs also fulfill certain characteristics. First, scalability. Imaging there is a resource like a web app, vm, database, etc.
And it needs to be scale up by increasing size. Increasing size means increasing resources like CPU, memory, or maybe faster storage. In this case, we are moving along the vertical line. That's why this is called **vertical scaling**. Increasing the size of the resource is called scaling up. If you decrease the size, decrease the power of the machine, this is called scaling it down.
Besides changing the size of the resource, changing the power of that resource, you can also scale by adding more resources to your environment. 
Increasing the amount of the resources themselves, in this case we are moving along the horizontal line that's why this is called **horizontal scaling**.
