# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **IaaS** is the most flexible cloud service model, giving you maximum control over your resources.
- The **cloud provider** manages:
    - Physical hardware
    - Network connectivity to the internet
    - Physical security
- **You** are responsible for:
    - OS installation, configuration, and maintenance
    - Network setup and management
    - Database and storage configuration
    - Patching, updates, and security

## Shared Responsibility Model

- In IaaS, most responsibilities are on you, except for physical infrastructure and connectivity, which the provider manages.

## Common Scenarios for IaaS

- **Lift-and-shift migration:** Move your on-premises workloads to cloud-based infrastructure with minimal changes.
- **Testing and development:** Rapidly create and replicate dev/test environments, start or stop resources as needed, and retain full control.

> **Key Benefit:**  
> IaaS lets you rent datacenter hardware in the cloud and gives you the freedom to configure and manage everything else.
