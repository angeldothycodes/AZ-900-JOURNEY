# Service Lifecycle in Azure | Public Preview and General Availability

Service lifecycle in Azure defines a process of how every Azure service is released for public use.
Every Azure service has its own lifecycle. The process of building Azure service follows a typical development path. It starts with requirement gathering> followed by development > testing. When the service is ready for wider use, it's then released to the public.
The first release to the public is done by releasing a preview version of the service. At this stage, most of the service functionality is ready so customers can use it and test it. This stage is called **public preview**. Think of it like a beta for your service. 
**Public preview** is designed to allow customers to experiment with the service, provide feedback, and for Microsoft to incorporate that feedback to improve the service before the final release is made.

When the service is validated, it's then released to the public for the second time, this time as a production-ready service. This stage is known as a **general availability**, in short **GA**. When the service is in **general availability**, Microsoft will keep improving the service and bringing new features in. Those features might land directly in GA but often they will be marked as a public preview too.
It's entirely possible to use this service that has been GA'ed long time ago that has still certain features in public preview.
You always need to be aware if the service that you're using and the features are already available for a general use, for the production use
