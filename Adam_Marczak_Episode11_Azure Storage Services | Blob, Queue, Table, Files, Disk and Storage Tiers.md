**Before we move to those services, let's talk about general classification of data**
- For **structured data**, the idea is very simple. This means your data is laid out so nicely that you can describe it using specific schema
- So for each table, each row of the table, you can define what are ht eproperties of each row, what are the type of those properties and each row that you insert into that table has to follow the schema.
- If you have multiple tables, you can define relationships between those tables. This is the scenario that you typically see in relational databases

- Second data is **Semi-structured**. In this case, you still have a table but each row within this table do not need to follow any specific schema. That means each row can have its own unique properties . The only common property is usually some sort of a key like an ID column.
- We can say this is a less fomalized way of storing our data.

- Lastly, we have **unstructured data**. Data like images, movies, applications of binary application files, txt file, and many more files. Files that do not follow structure that can represent pretty much any kind of data.
