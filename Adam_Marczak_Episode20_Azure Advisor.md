## Azure Advisor

 In order to talk about Azure Advisor, let's picture a scenario. Typically when building solutions in Azure, we will have multiple services. Services like SQL databases, web services, or virtual machines.Those services has to be set up by someone- our developers, administrators, operation teams, or just external vendors but the only problem with this approach is that none of us are experts when it comes to all of Azure services so it's very easy to miss some critical configuration that might impact your application or entire platform. Here comes Azure Advisor. It's a service that was created to continuously scan those services for all the improvements according to Microsoft best practices. 

Imagine: If you are starting with Azure, Microsoft might have some good tips for you that will improve how your application works and how you operate your entire Azure platform. The recommendations you can get are around cost of your Azure resources, their performance, reliability, security, and lastly, operational excellence.
All of the recommendations are then provided to either admins or developers. You can even setup some alerts to get automatically notified when there are new recommendations.
