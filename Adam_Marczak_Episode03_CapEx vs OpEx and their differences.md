Expenditure is an action of spending your company funds and how your expenditure

**Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**
- basically means buying your own infrastructure

Even though most companies moved to the cloud, this model is very often seen even these days. In CapEx, if you would draw a diagram showing the cost of running your infrastructure, over time you would see a very big spike at this start because in a typical company environment, when you make a purchase like this, you invest a lot of money. You'll want to make sure that your investment is future-proof. So you will want to buy a bigger server so that it can fit more applications in the future. You will want to have more modern motherboards, so it can be expanded in the future. All of those costs drive the intiial investment higher and higher but once the initial investment is made, there's a very low maintenance cost moving forward because you will need to pay for the power for those servers for the networking, for some hardware replacements, and for some suport staff to maintain those servers up and running. Buying servers in this model means you buy a static capacity of the server but in real scenarios, your application will use that capacity over time when they grow or when more applications come until they use the full capcity of the server. All the capacity until that happens is wasted. Additionally, because you are managing your own infrastructure, you'll have a lot of additional maintenance required while the maintenance cost is small, you still will be required to hire some people to manage those. Then you will need to provide a stable power and networking source for your servers , you will need to replace the hardware that fails and all the operational stuff that is required to manage your own infrastructure. 
**Capital Expenditure is about being able to commit to resources upfront and make that big initial investment**




**Operational Expenditure**
- renting infrastructure, buyig services
-  the Cloud perfectly fits into this model


If we take the same example as previously, increasing usage overtime. If we would again draw the diagram of the cost of our infrastructure overtime, the diagram would look much different because we would be only paying for what we use because our cost is solely based on the usage, that means server capacity always matches what you are using and therefore there is no initial investment unless you are actually buying something upfront. And when it comes to maintenance, in cloud, most of the maintenance is actually performed by the cloud vendor. You only need to maintain small operation teams to manage the most important tasks around your infrastructure. Other than that, Microsoft manages everything and this is included in the price when you're purchasing services.



**COMPARING THE TWO**
