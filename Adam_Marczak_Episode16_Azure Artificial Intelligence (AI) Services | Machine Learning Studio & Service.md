**AI** is a branch of computer science where we use our software to simulate human intelligence and capabilities

Whereas **Machine Learning** is a subcategory of AI where we use that software and teach it to draw some conclusions and make some predictions based on our data and the process of teaching the software to do that is caled building a model. 
The key service to do that in Azure is called **Azure Machine Learning**
Typically, the process of building a machine learning model consists of training the model based on our data then packaging and validating that model. If we are happy with the results, we can deploy those models as a web services then monitoring those web services and retraining the model to get even better results. Azure Machine Learning is here to help us with this entire process by providing us with set of tools. Tools like notebooks written in Python or R or a visual designer which allows us to build machine learning models using a simple drag and drop experience directly in our browsers. Additionally machine learning models allows us to manage all the compute
