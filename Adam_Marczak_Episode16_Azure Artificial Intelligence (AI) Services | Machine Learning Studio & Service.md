**AI** is a branch of computer science where we use our software to simulate human intelligence and capabilities

Whereas **Machine Learning** is a subcategory of AI where we use that software and teach it to draw some conclusions and make some predictions based on our data and the process of teaching the software to do that is caled building a model. 
The key service to do that in Azure is called **Azure Machine Learning**
Typically, the process of building a machine learning model consists of training the model based on our data then packaging and validating that model. If we are happy with the results, we can deploy those models
