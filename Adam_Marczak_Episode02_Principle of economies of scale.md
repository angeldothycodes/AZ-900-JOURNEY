Simplified example
- Delivery company that delivers a packages to its customers. When you start your own company, you usually start at very small scale- for instance, by prucahsing three delivery trucks. When you do that, you will need to buy them. Since the company is very small and you're just starting, most like make individual purchase for each of those cars.

Let's imagine you paid $10,000 for each. Regardless if those cars are used or not, you will need to spend some money on the maintenance of those cars. Because your company is very small, you cannot make any contracts. You will need to pay individually for each repair, each maintenance taht you need to perform on your own cars. Each car of course needs to be insured so that's additional cost that you need to make individually and as you can imagine, there will be plenty of other costs that you will need to incur when running your own company. Based on the cost that you need to incur and the amount of the customers that you have, you will need to calculate the price of your service in order to stay profitable and stay on the market- that price is called **price per unit**. At price that you need to charge for the delivery of your package for your company to stay profitable.

What happens if you company grows in size. If your scale will go from three cars, for instance, to 300 because your compant is already big, you might be able to buy your cars in bulk on the dealership at the discounted price. Instead of buying them for 10,000, maybe buy them for nine. The same for maintence, you will be able to sign some contract with some car repair shop- lowering the price of the maintenance required for your cars. Same goes for insurance because you can buy insurance in bulk. And if you have some shared services, maybe hire some additional stuff to maintain your company, you will be also able to reduce price per car taht is required to maintain your company because the scale of your company is much greater than before. You are now able to handle many more customers without sacrificing the quality of your service  allowing you to lower the price per unit. So you get more benefits internally by having large company. You are more efficient operationally, and you can share those benefits with your customers by reducing the price per unit. In this case, this will also make your company much more competitive on the market, making sure that you grow even further. 



To quickly summarize, as your company grows, your price per unit lowers because companies are getting more efficient at what they are doing. A small company, you price per unit will be quite high. If you have medium company, your price per unit will be better but at still quite medium range. And if you have very large companies, your price will be quite low and very competitive on the market. This principle perfectly describes what is happening with the cloud as the cloud grows and it has more customers, the price of their services will go down because big companies like Microsoft will get more efficient at what they do.

In case of Microsoft, they will get more efficient on building new datacenters, getting better prices for the hardware, there of course will be hardware advancements which will again lower the price and when this happens and Microsoft still wants to stay competitive, the prices of the services that it offers will also go down and that's really it. This is how economies of scale work and how they drive the cost of your other services.
