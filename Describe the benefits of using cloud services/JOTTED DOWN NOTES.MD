# Benefits of High Availability and Scalability in the Cloud

Two biggest consideration when building a cloud application is the uptime (availability) and the ability to handle demand (or scale).

## High Availability
- Ensures IT resources and applications are available when needed.
- Focuses on maintaining uptime despite disruptions.
- Azure offers service availability guarantees through **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**.

## Scalability
- Adjusts cloud resources to meet demand efficiently.
- Helps prevent system overloads during peak traffic.
- Reduces costs by scaling down unused resources.
- Operates on a **consumption-based pricing model**â€”pay only for what you use.

### Types of Scaling:
#### Vertical Scaling:
- Increases or decreases resource capabilities (CPU, RAM).
- Example: Upgrading or downgrading a virtual machine's specs.

#### Horizontal Scaling:
- Adjusts the number of deployed resources dynamically.
- Example: Adding or removing virtual machines or containers based on demand.

By leveraging **high availability** and **scalability**, cloud solutions can maintain uptime and optimize costs effectively.
