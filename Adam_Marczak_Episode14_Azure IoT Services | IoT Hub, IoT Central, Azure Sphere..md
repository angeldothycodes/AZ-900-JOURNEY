### Internet of Things

What is **Internet of Things**? It is a network of internet connected devices, so called IoT devices. Those devices are embedded with everyday objects and they enable those objects to send and receive data from the cloud such as settings or telemetry. Most of us have some sort of IoT device at home whether it's as simple as smart lighting, a mobile phone, a plant wantering system, or something more complex like a door lock or a smart car. To build solutions in those IoT devices, you need a specific set of services for that purpose.
