### Internet of Things

What is **Internet of Things**? It is a network of internet connected devices, so called IoT devices. Those devices are embedded with everyday objects and they enable those objects to send and receive data from the cloud such as settings or telemetry. Most of us have some sort of IoT device at home whether it's as simple as smart lighting, a mobile phone, a plant wantering system, or something more complex like a door lock or a smart car. To build solutions in those IoT devices, you need a specific set of services for that purpose.


## Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT hub allows for bi-directional communication between the cloud and IoT devices and then allows developers to take advantage of this information to provide insights monitoring and develop custom solutions for their IoT platform.

The key things to remember about Iot Hubs are:
- It's a managed service for bi-directional communication between the cloud and IoT devices

- It's a Platform as a Service offering in Azure for IoT development

- It's highly secure, scalable, and reliable service for IoT

- IoT hubs perfectly integrates with a lot of Azure services and has a lot of SDKs for the most popular languages on the market so that your teams do not need to learn any new language to take advantage of IoT hub for their development purposes

- It also has support for multiple common standards on the market when it comes to communication protocols.


Just by looking at this list, we can very easily see that Microsoft created IoT hub to help developers build custom IoT solutions.

## Azure IoT Central

If building solutions from scratch is not something that your organization wants to do then you should look at Azure IoT central.
IoT central is very similar to IoT hub but it works on an entirely different level. It still allows for connectivity of your IoT devices with the cloud but **IoT central** as a service provides you a set of template for building applications using a standardized templates. It's an application delivery platform for IoT, for device management, and centralization purposes. This is an amazing solutions for organizations that want to take advantage of IoT and they don't want to build applications from scratch.

The key things that you need to know about IoT central is that this is an IoT application platform. It's a software as a service solution that allows you to use industry specific app templates to get out of the box solutions for your IoT devices and manage them at scale in the cloud. Microsoft with the service wants to allow their customers to build IoT solutions without the need to have very deep technical knowledge about IoT solutions. So the main goal of this service is to provide with application templates so you can very easily connect, manage, and monitor your IoT devices at scale.
Similarly to IoT hub, this service is highly secure, scalable, and very reliable so you can build you applications without worrying about the platform itself.
Lastly, this service is actully built on top of **IoT hub** and 30 other azure services.
