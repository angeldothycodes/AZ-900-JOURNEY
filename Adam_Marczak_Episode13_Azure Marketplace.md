## Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace is very similar to online shop. You can select your products that you need, add them to your basket, and hit purchase. You can also search for the products that you need. Similar to that, in marketplace, you search for services and there are templates for those services provided by Microsoft and other vendors. A simple template can provide one or multiple services. From your perspective, Azure marketplace is simply azure shop where you purchase azure services or out of the box solutions that take advantage of Azure services. Inside of the Azure marketplace, you can find products created by both Microsoft but also third-party vendors. If your company builds a solutions that based on Azure services or very well integrates with them, you can build you own templates and publish them to Azure marketplace so that you customers can not only find you but easily purchase services with a simple click of a button. The products that you will find within Azure marketplace might consist of services in all three categories. They might take advantage of Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service.
