## Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace is very similar to online shop. You can select your products that you need, add them to your basket, and hit purchase. You can also search for the products that you need. Similar to that, in marketplace, you search for services and there are templates for those services provided by Microsoft and other vendors. A simple template can provide one or multiple services. From your perspective, Azure marketplace is simply azure shop where you purchase azure services or out of the box solutions that take advantage of Azure services. Inside of the Azure marketplace, you can find products created by both Microsoft but also third-party vendors. If your company builds a solutions that based on Azure services or very well integrates with them, you can build you own templates and publish them to Azure marketplace so that you customers can not only find you but easily purchase services with a simple click of a button. The products that you will find within Azure marketplace might consist of services in all three categories. They might take advantage of Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service.

Lastly, Azure Marketplace is part of something bigger called commercial marketplace. Apparently, there are two commercial marketplaces. One is called **Microsoft AppSource** and second is called **Azure Marketplace**. Inside of the **Appsource**, you have products available for multiple Microsoft platforms like Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 platform whereas in **Azure Marketplace**, you will only find products available for Azure.

But besides the product availability, the other major difference is that the users those portal are targeting. For **Azure Marketplace**, the key target, the users that should be using this portal are **developers and IT professionals** who are building their solutions based on Azure services. Whereas for **Microsoft AppSoure**, the target are business users
