## Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace is very similar to online shop. You can select your products that you need, add them to your basket, and hit purchase. You can also search for the products that you need. Similar to that, in marketplace, you search for services and there are templates for those services provided by Microsoft and other vendors. A simple template can provide one or multiple services. From your perspective, Azure marketplace is simply azure shop where you purchase azure services or out of the box solutions that take advantage of Azure services
