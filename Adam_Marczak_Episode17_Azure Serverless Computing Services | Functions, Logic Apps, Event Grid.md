Serverless computing is a way of hosting your application in the cloud while completely abstracting the infrastructure part. We are just deploying our applications or out of the box products available in Azure and let Microsoft scale up and out of infrastructure to match our demand

## Azure Functions

We'ev already talked about **Azure Functions** as part of the Compute episode. 
Reitetraion: while they are a compute resource, they're also a serverless compute resource

Azure Functions is a service that allows customers to build application using code. 
Small pieces of code and host those as web services. In which case, customers create small pieces of code, package them, and send them to the function app. From that point onward, that is the serverless part because Azure Function app will grab your code and deploy this across multiple servers and allow external services to communicate with your application. If necessary, scaling up and down depending on your need.
