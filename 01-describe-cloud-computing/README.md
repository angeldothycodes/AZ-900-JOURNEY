What is cloud computing


Cloud computing = delivery of computing services over the internet
Computing services= common IT infrastructure (e.g virtual amchines, storage, databases, and networking)

Cloud services expand the tradiational IT offerings to include things like IoT, ML and AI.

If you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don't have to wait to build a new datacenter- you can use the cloud for rapid expand of IT footprint.


Cloud computing lets youc hoose the power and features you need to run your software. 

The difference is, with Cloud computing, the PC is in a Cloud provider's data center instead of it being physical. With that said, it lets you pay for only the services you use, pus someone else to geth to manage the upkeep of the computer.

Each Cloud provider have their own selection of services to choose from, but the basic services provided by all Cloud providers are compute power and stoirage. 

Compute power is how much processing your computer can do. Like whn buying a home computer, you may choose computer with 8GbB of RAm and the latest processor to run the software you need currently but as the load on the computer grows, the system slows down. With Cloud computing you can add and remove computer power as you need it. This saves on cost sinc eyou only pay for the resources you use. 

Storage is the volume of data you can store on your computer. A traditional computer has limited hard drive space. Over time, you may have to run out and buy another hard drive to store more data. With Cloud computing, you can request more storage as you need it.
