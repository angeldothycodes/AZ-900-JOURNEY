Generally speaking, DevOps is a set of practices that combine both development and operations.
The goal here is to shorten the development lifecyly by providing customers with set of tools for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of their software and high quality of their deliverables.

In short, **deliver faster while ensuring high quality**

## Azure DevOps

Features of Azure Devops Service:

- **Boards** - this feature allows customers to track their work, track their progress across the team members but also manage all the deliverables, all the work status, all the features, and user stories for the project in a single place

- Additionally, with Azure DevOps you have **repos**. Repos allow you to manage code repositories and code versioning for your project and their deliverables

- With **pipelines**, you can create automated builds and automated deployment processes for your code and your application across multiple environments

- With **Azure artifacts**, you can create, hosts, share packages with your team, you can also add the artifacts that you created to your CI/CD pipelines with a single click, etc

- **Azure Test Plans** which allows us to track our testing progress with manual and exploratory testing tools

**ALL OF THESE FEATURES ARE COMBINED INTO AZURE DEVOPS**
And if these features are not enough, any features missing, there is always marketplace with over a thousand available additions to Azure DevOps so you can extend the basic functionalities and customize everything to your needs

### Key Characteristics

Azure DevOps is a collection of services that help customers build solutions with use of devops practices and they do that by providing you with set of services, services like boards for tracking and managing your work on the project, pipelines to build your CI/CD workflows, repos to manage and collaborate on your code, has plans to manage your tests and exploratory testing and manual testing and artifacts to manage all the prject deliverables

If there's anything missing, just go to Marketplace and extend the functionalities of Azure DevOps.

One thing to note here is that **DevOps** originally was called **TFS** (team foundation server) on premises then moved to the cloud where it was called **VSTS** (Visual Studio Team Services) and now, it's called **Azure DevOps**.

- A little bit similar to **Azure Machine Learning Service** because it's all about providing a workspace for the users within Azure. User connect to devtest labs and they are able to provision virutal machines. 
  
- It is simple as it is. Users like developers and testers coming to **Azure DevTest Labs** where they create virtual machines by choosing what kind of image they choose for their operating system, their base image, then they additionally install some artifacts like Visual Studio or maybe 7-zip or Git and they can do this configuration for every single VM that they create. You can choose any kind of artifcats they want and any kind of operating systems. The goal here is very simple- DevTest Labs aims to provide users with the ability to create virtual machines at will so they can very quickly test things, develop things, and destroy them as soon as they don't need it. And they provide it within a single concise workspace in Azure. But in order to control the cost and organizational resources, admins can come to Azure DevTest labs and provide sets of policies like which operating system images can be used, what kind of virtual machines are available, what kind pf quotas each user has so how many VMs can each user can provision. All of these will be cost-effective while providing great flexibility for developers and testers.

### Key Characteristics

- Azure DevTest Labs is a service within Azure that allows developers and testers to provision and manage their sandbox environments for testing and development purposes.

- It does it by providing with the ability to create self-managed virtual machines quickly and effectively with some pre-configured templates or additional artifacts like tools, applications, or even custom actions created by your organization. Additionally, you have lab policies which allow you to control the cost for your environments by applying some quotas, sizes, auto-shutdown polices and many others.

- You can akso share your existing labs and automate everything using custom images and with some pre-made plugins, APIs, and tools. You can automate everything using CI/CD pipelines with tools like Azure Devops so you can get more effective as your organization grows in size.
