# Azure Security Center

**Azure Security Center** is responsible for continuously scanning your Azure services. Whether those are Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), security Center continuously scans those services and helps you protect your Azure environment. 
Additionally, Security Center provides you with recommendations so that your administrators and developers can act immediately and protect their environments on their own. One cool feature of security center is that while it protects Azure Services, you can also install agents on your on-premise Virtual Machines to extend the functionality of Security Center to protect your hybrid environments. If this reminds you of something, it's probably **Azure Advisor**. We've talked about how **Azure Advisor** scans your environments and provide you with a lot of recommendations including security recommendations. It is worth noting that those security recommendations are actually provided by Security Center itself. You can review your recommendations directly in Security Center or you can act and review them in Azure Advisor
